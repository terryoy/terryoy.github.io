I'm trying to get more familiar with linux shell, some software are ready to use in GNU coreutils, but we seldom talk about them, so the knowledge are left to people who really take time to study it.

So I would like to add some notes to the programs I encountered and I think it would be a good handbook for me to lookup.

I also want to add some rating to each tool, so that I can know the complexity of the program, rated by number of options, because sometimes we only use a small portion of functions of the program, but actually it can be used in many circumstances if you explore more, Ratings vary from 1-5. 


### 1. wc - word/line/character/byte count



##### desc

Complexity: 1




##### example

```

```

### 2. tr - translate character


##### desc


##### example
```


```



### 3. sort - sort or merge records(lines)


##### desc



##### example

```
```
