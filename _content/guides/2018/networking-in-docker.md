After installed an Ubuntu container in my docker, now I'm trying to learn the networking tools in Ubuntu and Docker.

1. Networking Tools in Ubuntu Again

```bash
# package for ifconfig(which is too old)
$ apt install net-tools

# newer package for networking
$ apt install iproute2

# ping command
$ apt install iputils-ping

# check network interface
$ ifconfig
eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 02:42:ac:11:00:02  
          inet addr:172.17.0.2  Bcast:0.0.0.0  Mask:255.255.0.0
          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
          RX packets:5956 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
          TX packets:3345 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
          collisions:0 txqueuelen:0
          RX bytes:8376715 (8.3 MB)  TX bytes:186204 (186.2 KB)
```


2. Docker Commands for Networking

There are three types of networks in docker, and the `bridge` network is by default presented in all docker instances.

```bash
# List networks in Docker
$ docker network ls
NETWORK ID          NAME                DRIVER              SCOPE
a6bf46c2bc44        bridge              bridge              local
e3826e52e7e6        host                host                local
08a134ed472c        none                null                local

# Check docker's network detail
$ docker network inspect bridge
[
    {
        "Name": "bridge",
        "Id": "a6bf46c2bc44dc16523ac28edd5524fccef79b779ae52602c868001763cd21c4",

            "Config": [
                {
                    "Subnet": "172.17.0.0/16",
                    "Gateway": "172.17.0.1"
                }
            ]
        },
        "Internal": false,
        "Attachable": false,
        "Ingress": false,
        "ConfigFrom": {
            "Network": ""

            "com.docker.network.bridge.name": "docker0",
            "com.docker.network.driver.mtu": "1500"
        },
        "Labels": {}
    }
]


```

### 3. Internal Networking

By default, the container is connected within a local network(172.17.0.1/16) bridged to the host machine, host can access the net gateway ip `172.17.0.1`. The contianers should be able to access each other in the local network provided by this net gateway. When you use the command `docker network inspect bridge`, you could see the list of containers and their IPs assigned.

#### 3.1 Accessing container's service by port mapping

Some containers as Nginx provide a service through a local port, in which case you could use port forwarding by your local IP. For example, you can check this port forwarding by `docker port` command or just listing the containers:

```bash
# list ports for container
$ docker port nginx
80/tcp -> 0.0.0.0:5000

# list containers
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS                   PORTS                  NAMES
cfc178841a79        ubuntu              "/bin/bash"              3 weeks ago         Up 4 hours                                      ubuntu
0200f61f5d65        nginx               "nginx -g 'daemon ofâ€¦"   2 months ago        Up 3 minutes             0.0.0.0:5000->80/tcp   webserver



```

Now you can see there is a port mapping from `host:5000` to `container:80`.

By default, no port is opened for a container to host, you need to specify the port mapping at `docker run` command with `-p`.

```
# `-d` is when you needed it run as a daemon.
$ docker run nginx -d -p 5000:80 --name nginx nginx

```

To open a port mapping for an existing container is very tricky. It is often said that you need to create another container instance based on the current just to open a port.


#### 3.2 Creating a Network

Now let's try something advanced. Let's create the different types of network one by one.

##### 3.2.1 Bridge Network

By default, the network you created will be a `bridged` network. You can add container to the network later. It creates a subnet and open only specific ports to the host to access service in the subnet, like NAT.

```bash

$ docker network create gamezone
$ docker network ls
NETWORK ID          NAME                DRIVER              SCOPE
0fe8bfe5222d        gamezone            bridge              local

# if you want to remove the bridge network
$ docker network rm gamezone



```

Now let's create an Ubuntu container called "gamecenter" which connects to the gamezone network and maps port 5000 to the docker host's 15000.

```bash
$ docker create --name gamecenter \
        --network gamezone \
        --publish 15000:5000 \
        -t -i ubuntu /bin/bash

$ docker container ls -a
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS                      PORTS                     NAMES
8cf4e293aae9        ubuntu              "/bin/bash"              10 minutes ago      Up 10 minutes               0.0.0.0:15000->5000/tcp   gamecenter

$ docker network inspect gamezone
[
    {
        "Name": "gamezone",
        "Id": "9b6417528a0e4a37ab9818e185a8046af06b3a9ae0eba40a2e494087676b70c9",
        "Created": "2018-06-09T15:24:43.6288314Z",
        "Scope": "local",
        "Driver": "bridge",
        "EnableIPv6": false,
        "IPAM": {
            "Driver": "default",
            "Options": {},
            "Config": [
                {
                    "Subnet": "172.18.0.0/16",
                    "Gateway": "172.18.0.1"
                }
            ]
        },
        "Internal": false,
        "Attachable": false,
        "Ingress": false,
        "ConfigFrom": {
            "Network": ""
        },
        "ConfigOnly": false,
        "Containers": {
            "8cf4e293aae932693f6769eea08665306485b17018999d8725f14b659e51c919": {
                "Name": "gamecenter",
                "EndpointID": "6ca3d79c633520dbee752ab6b462404aa8507f8eb9f2b2cf840de2d3322d27bb",
                "MacAddress": "02:42:ac:12:00:02",
                "IPv4Address": "172.18.0.2/16",
                "IPv6Address": ""
            }
        },
        "Options": {},
        "Labels": {}
    }
]

$ docker start gamecenter
$ docker attach gamecenter
$ ifconfig
eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 02:42:ac:12:00:02  
          inet addr:172.18.0.2  Bcast:172.18.255.255  Mask:255.255.0.0
          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
          RX packets:20872 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
          TX packets:8684 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
          collisions:0 txqueuelen:0
          RX bytes:28266802 (28.2 MB)  TX bytes:476241 (476.2 KB)

```

You can notice that the container "gamecenter" is running in the subnet of `172.18.0.1` currently. And we have open a port `15000` on the host, to map to gamecenter's port `5000`.
