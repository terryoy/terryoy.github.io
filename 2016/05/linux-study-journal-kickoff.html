    <title>Linux Study Journal - (1) Kick Off - Hello, World!</title>

    <meta name="description" content="I have an used Japanese IBM G40 PC, which has Pentium 4 (2.5GHz) processor, 512MB RAM and a 140GB hard disk (I believe the hardware spec has been changed by the used PC seller). Since the power consumption and the speed are not suitable for very modern applications, I decided to use it as an experiment machine for the minimal linux workspace. This series of blog posts will be the progress showing how I work on this machine to make it very friendly and efficient for daily used.

I started to boot with the Ubuntu 16.04 LTS server image(flashed on a USB stick), the booting is a bit strange than previous versions, it shows a &quot;boot:&quot; prompt which need you to tells what to boot, but it&#39;s not difficult to find out how to boot into the installation mode.

The reason using Ubuntu latest version is because I want to keep up with the development of the software packages, debian is in a very stable status, while the Ubuntu packages are active enough to try out new things. I format the whole disk and install Ubuntu only on the disk. This is the starting point.

I&#39;m so exciting at the moment when I finish all the installation and reboot, because I finally get this project started! But the first problem come very quickly - <strong>when I try to lower the lid, the screen just go dark, and when I reopen it, the going hibernate process sticks in every few seconds</strong>. I think there is some problem with the led sensor, because it automatically goes into hibernate a few seconds later when I activate again. So I think it is related to the power options in system settings.

This problem leads me to know about the <strong>&quot;systemd&quot;</strong> program. Searching solutions on the internet, I find out the settings in systemd will handle the power related key event. It sets how system react when user press Power key, Hibernate Key, Lid close/open, etc.

```bash
$ sudo vi /etc/systemd/logind.conf
(
-change 

-to
HandleLidSwitch=ignore
)

$ sudo service systemd-logind restart

```

This helps me to get over the hibernation problem at once. <strong>Systemd</strong> is a Linux system and service manager. There is similar programs like ubuntu&#39;s &quot;upstart&quot;, or Mac OS&#39;s &quot;launchd&quot;. You can search for more info about it.

There are two other power related packages <code>acpi</code> and <code>acpid</code>. The Ubuntu document recommends that you can remove the packages if you do not have a laptop. 

Although I set some Japanese keyboard layout in the installation, but it doesn&#39;t match all the keys with my Japanese IBM G40 keyboard. Apparently I need to switch the keyboard layout and do a few tests. The configuration program I used here is <code>dpkg-reconfigure</code>, which allows you to configure a package again after they&#39;re installed. The package will be &quot;keyboard-configuration&quot;.

```bash

$ sudo dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration
```

The above one already solved the problem. I changed the keyboard model to IBM ThinkPad T60/R60/T61/R61, then it says the layout of this keyboard varies in different country, so I&#39;m able to choose the &quot;Japanese&quot; as the country of the origin layout. 

Some threads mentioned about the <code>console-setup</code> as I found out it is mainly for the encoding and the font set in the console, it might be related to the problem but not at this point. I may referred back if I try to work with Chinese character in the console.

```bash

$ sudo dpkg-reconfigure console-setup
<code>
A little more on dpkg-reconfigure, if you use</code>man dpkg-recongure<code>to check its manual, you will find another related command called</code>debconf-show```. It shows you all the current configurations of the package. So before you go with &quot;dpkg-reconfigure&quot;, you can check the configuration first.

<code>bash
$ sudo debconf-show keyboard-configuration
</code>
It shows how many configuration items of the package and their values. Check out the man page for &quot;keyboard-configuration&quot;, &quot;console-setup&quot;, &quot;dpkg-reconfigure&quot; and &quot;debconf-show&quot; to explore more." />
