# Terry Ouyang

Hello, I'm an software engineer in Shenzhen. This web site is mostly for me saving some useful information and documentations during my development practices.

I have years experience in Java Enterprise projects, but now my interests move on to Python, Mobile Apps, Interaction Design and Maker community.

I'm a member of the maker group [SZDIY](http://szdiy.org/). We have regular meetups every Thursday night at [Chaihuo Makerspace](http://chaihuo.org/).

We always have time to listen to your interesting hacking stories.

Cheers,<br/>
Terry
